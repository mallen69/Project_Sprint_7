# Module 1: Acquiring Data and Data Formats
  *"Getting" the data you want to analyze means downloading it from websites, connecting to and querying databases, extracting it from HTML webpages, interfacing with APIs (Application Programmer Interfaces) importing and exporting files, and converting back and forth between data formats. Programming languages, databases, command line-based applications and graphical applications each have something to offer*

# Module 2: Basic Data Manipulation
*Before you engage in structured analysis, you often just want to “see” the data. This can mean pre-viewing a subset of it, summarizing the columns/attributes/features, sorting or reorganizing it and otherwise finding ways to immerse yourself in your data. Again, each data tool has something to offer, and our objective is to develop a good sense of the utilities available to you.*

# Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
*Data analysis is built around questions, and exploratory data analysis helps you know what questions to ask. Descriptive statistics and basic visualizations that summarize features or suggest relationships inspire the generation of hypotheses to confirm with statistical tests or build into statistical models.*

|I need to summarize the data I have so that I can report basic findings| I need to identify errors and inconsistencies in the data so that I can develop solutions to address them, and possibly their source| I need to produce basic visual plots and summary statistics of the central tendencies and range of my data set so that I can develop an intuition for and a familiarity with my data set| I need to construct inventories and quality assessment of the data available so that I can propose high value ways to use the data assets|

## Sprint 6: Preliminary Findings and Hypotheses
|Data Journalist| Data Engineer | Statistical Modeler| Business Analyst |
