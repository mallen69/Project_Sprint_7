    "- *After this class I expect to be able to understand more coding and programming vocabulary and community, understand more about the purpose and value of different programs we use, understand how to engage with our own data more.*\n",
    "- *I expect this classroom and environment to support my goals and objectives by explaining things clearly, giving clear instructions and examples, being patient with my lack of experience.*\n",
    "- *In reaching my goals, my coaches and cohort are responsible for providing a supportive learning environment.* \n",
    "- *In reaching my goals, I am responsible for asking for calrity, showing up, doing all assigned work to the best of my understanding and ability, making extra time and effort when I don't feel like I get it.* \n",

    "- *Here is how I envision my life will look after I complete this class: I will be able to command a higher salary within my current job, get a cooler title, and ask for higher pay in any new organizations or industry I apply into, and I present myself as someone who takes initiative and challenges myself for the benefit of the organizations I work for.*\n",
    "- *Here is how I envision myself after I complete this class:  I will feel like an informed and competent person in conversations and projects related to data analysis and coding and programming in general.*\n",
    "- *This is the type of job I can imagine myself working in after I complete this class: I'd like to stay in a mission-based organization.*\n",
    "- *This is what I would like to be doing 6 months after this class ends: asking for more raises, producing a tangible benefit to my company for funding this course.*\n",
    "- *This is what I would like to be doing in 5 years: Sleeping 8 hours a night, reading a lot, not letting work interfere with surfing and yoga, feeling calm, secure, effecient and fulfilled in my work and career*\n",
    "- *What I want most out of life is to... and this is supporting that desire: What I want most out of life is to take advantage of rare and unique opportunities, and being open despite feelings of inadequacy and incompetency and isolation is supporting that desire because I feel down and fearful but do things anyway.*"
