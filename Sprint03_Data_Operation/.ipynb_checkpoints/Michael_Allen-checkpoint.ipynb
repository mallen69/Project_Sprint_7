    "\n",
    "One easy handling of such scenarios is using library(janitor), as name suggested can be employed for cleaning and maintaining. Janitor has function by name clean_names() which can be useful while directly importing the data itself as show in the below example:\n",

    "haven reads SPSS, Stata, and SAS files.  \n",
    "readxl reads excel files (both .xls and .xlsx).    \n",
    "DBI, along with a database specific backend (e.g. RMySQL, RSQLite, RPostgreSQL etc) allows you to run SQL queries against a database and return a data frame.  \n",
    "For hierarchical data: use jsonlite (by Jeroen Ooms) for json, and xml2 for XML. Jenny Bryan has some excellent worked examples at https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/.  \n",
    "For other file types, try the R data import/export manual and the rio package.  \n",

During this process I learned how to write all of this in a R script along with the comments and I titled it \" Cleaning_the_Excel_Dirty_Data.R\"  \n"
