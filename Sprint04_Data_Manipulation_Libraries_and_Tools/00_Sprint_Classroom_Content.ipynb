    "> Unfortunately, data wrangling is 80% of what a data scientist does. It’s where most of the real value is created and it’s the most thankless, difficult, and poorly understood job I know of. Nobody gets a degree in data wrangling. Nobody publishes papers on it. Nobody teaches how to do it. (Yes there are courses on how to use specific tools like R or Python to do simple joins and dupe removal, but they assume that you already know how and why you are wrangling.)\n",

    "Create new data by calculating new fields and recategorizing\n",
    "Visualize the data to remove outliers and illogical results\n",
    "The first four are straightforward albeit annoying. Most people do steps 1 and 3 and then jump in to do their analysis. They then spend several weeks discovering all kinds of additional errors as they try to get their models to work.\n",

    "\"Numpy is the lowest level sitting on Python. It reads in fixed datatypes. It's data layout is more concerned with efficiency of memory. If you are dealing with strings they are fixed length strings. (fit the data size for each element to the longest string length) but it shines when you are dealing with number calculations. The more you can think in vectors the faster your code runs. (learn how to get rid of the for statements for speed reasons by using Numpy broadcasting)\n",
