    "Data Science from Scratch\n",
    "R For Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Patterns\n",
    "> Patterns provide one of the most useful tools for data scientists because they reveal covariation. If you think of variation as a phenomenon that creates uncertainty, covariation is a phenomenon that reduces it. If two variables covary, you can use the values of one variable to make better predictions about the values of the second. If the covariation is due to a causal relationship (a special case), then you can use the value of one variable to control the value of the second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation and Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    ">Very often, when analyzing data, you want to know if two variables are correlated. Informally, correlation answers the question, “When we increase (or decrease) x, does y increase (or decrease), and by how much?” \n",
    "\n",
    "> Formally, correlation measures the linear dependence between two random variables. Correlation measures range between −1 and 1; 1 means that one variable is a (positive) linear function of the other, 0 means the two variables aren’t correlated at all, and −1 means that one variable is a negative linear function of the other (the two move in completely op- posite directions; \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation Matrix\n",
    ">With many dimensions, you’d like to know how all the dimensions relate to one another. A simple approach is to look at the correlation matrix, in which the entry in row i and column j is the correlation between the ith dimension and the jth dimen‐ sion of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    ">A more visual approach (if you don’t have too many dimensions) is to make a scatter‐ plot matrix (Figure 10-4) showing all the pairwise scatterplots. To do that we’ll use plt.subplots(), which allows us to create subplots of our chart. We give it the num‐ ber of rows and the number of columns, and it returns a figure object (which we won’t use) and a two-dimensional array of axes objects (each of which we’ll plot to):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simpson’s Paradox\n",
    "> One not uncommon surprise when analyzing data is Simpson’s Paradox, in which correlations can be misleading when confounding variables are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Correlation and Causation\n",
    "> You have probably heard at some point that “correlation is not causation,” most likely by someone looking at data that posed a challenge to parts of his worldview that he was reluctant to question. Nonetheless, this is an important point—if x and y are strongly correlated, that might mean that x causes y, that y causes x, that each causes the other, that some third factor causes both, or it might mean nothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "> You might ask the question, “How do I take all of the variables I’ve collected and focus on only a few of them?” In technical terms, you want to “reduce the dimension of your feature space.” By reducing the dimension of your feature space, you have fewer relationships between variables to consider and you are less likely to overfit your model. (Note: This doesn’t immediately mean that overfitting, etc. are no longer concerns — but we’re moving in the right direction!)\n",
    "\n",
    ">Somewhat unsurprisingly, reducing the dimension of the feature space is called “dimensionality reduction.” There are many ways to achieve dimensionality reduction, but most of these techniques fall into one of two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    ">- Feature Elimination\n",
    ">- Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Principal Components Analysis\n",
    "> Another technique for analyzing data is principal components analysis. Principal components analysis breaks a set of (possibly correlated) variables into a set of un- correlated variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A brief description\n",
    "> https://towardsdatascience.com/a-one-stop-shop-for-principal-component-analysis-5582fb7e0a9c\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Factor Analysis\n",
    "> In most data analysis problems, there are some quantities that we can observe and some that we cannot. The classic examples come from the social sciences. Suppose that you wanted to measure intelligence. It’s not possible to directly measure an abstract concept like intelligence, but it is possible to measure performance on dif- ferent tests. You could use factor analysis to analyze a set of test scores (the observed values) to try to determine intelligence (the hidden value).\n",
    "Factor analysis is available in R through the function factanal in the stats package:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bootstrap Resampling\n",
    "> When analyzing statistics, analysts often wonder if the statistics are sensitive to a few outlying values. Would we get a similar result if we were to omit a few points? What is the range of values for the statistic? It is possible to answer these questions for an arbitrary statistic using a technique called bootstrapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Formally, bootstrap resampling is a technique for estimating the bias of an estimator. An estimator is a statistic calculated from a data sample that provides an estimate of a true underlying value, often a mean, a standard deviation, or a hidden parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Bootstrapping works by repeatedly selecting random observations from a data sam- ple (with replacement) and recalculating the statistic. In R, you can use bootstrap resampling through the boot function in the boot package:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lattice Graphic Package \n",
    "> Lattice functions make it easy to do some things that are hard to do with standard graphics, such as plotting multiple plots on the same page or superimposing plots. Additionally, most lattice functions produce clean, readable output by default. This chapter shows what lattice graphics can do and explains how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The real strength of the lattice package is in splitting a chart into different panels (shown in a grid), or groups (shown with different colors or symbols) using a con- ditioning or grouping variable. This chapter includes many examples that start with a simple chart and then split it into multiple pieces to answer a question raised by the original plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### k-means\n",
    "\n",
    "> Your goal is to segment the users. This process is known by various names: besides being called segmenting, you could say that you’re go‐ ing to stratify, group, or cluster the data. They all mean finding similar types of users and bunching them together.\n",
    "Why would you want to do this? Here are a few examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> • You might want to give different users different experiences. Mar‐ keting often does this; for example, to offer toner to people who are known to own printers.\n",
    "\n",
    "> • You might have a model that works better for specific groups. Or you might have different models for different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "> • Hierarchical modeling in statistics does something like this; for example, to separately model geographical effects from household effects in survey results.\n"
