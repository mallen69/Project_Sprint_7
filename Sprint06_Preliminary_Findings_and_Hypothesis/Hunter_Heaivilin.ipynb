    "The first part of this sprint project will be to trade datasets with a partner. The idea for the exercise is to think about what you think might be interesting about a dataset and create an EDA plan to explore it. Except the first pass will be for your partner to carry out your EDA plan and report back to you with preliminary findings.\n",
